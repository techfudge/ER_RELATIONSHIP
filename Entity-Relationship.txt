Based on the information provided, we can create an Entity-Relationship (ER) model for the gym chain. The model will include the following entities and their attributes:

Gymnasium:
gymnasium_id (unique identifier)
name
address
telephone_number
Member:
member_id (unique identifier)
last_name
first_name
address
date_of_birth
gender
Session:
session_id (unique identifier)
sport_type
schedule
Coach:
coach_id (unique identifier)
last_name
first_name
age
specialty
Now, we need to establish the relationships between these entities:

A Gymnasium can have multiple Members (one-to-many relationship)
A Member can register at one Gymnasium (one-to-one relationship)
A Gymnasium can have multiple Sessions (one-to-many relationship)
A Session can accommodate multiple Members (many-to-many relationship)
A Session is led by one or two Coaches (one-to-one or one-to-two relationship)
A Coach can lead multiple Sessions (one-to-many relationship)
To represent the relationships, we can use relationship lines between the entities
